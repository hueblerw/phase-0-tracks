# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  
	Version control is something that allows one to track and control changes to a file or set of files.
* Why is it useful?
	This is useful because it prevents you from damaging previous work while working on new things.
	It also allows you to backtrack to previous states if something goes catastrophically wrong.
	You can also have various partners work with the same materials and keep ordered track of who made what changes when why and how.
	You can also easily merge these separate changes together easily a process that could easily be very complex and mistake ridden itself.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch is a new series of changes to an existant branch or master.
	You use one whenever you are going to make changes to a project, especially if those changes are experimental.
	Whenever starting new material (like adding a new feature or implementing an update) you start a new branch
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit creates a save point along a branch and a snapshot of what is in the repository at that moment.
	A good commit message communicates clearly and concisely the nature of changes that are being made.
* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict occurs when two branches have diverged.
	This means that if there is different contents in the same location of the files from two different commits
		the computer will be confused as to which to implement and it will ask you to resolve the issue.
