What does the "Cascading" part of Cascading Style Sheets mean? 
It means that you can have more than one style sheet attached to any given html.

When there is a conflict between two CSS rules that select the same element, how does your browser decide which rule to use?
The one with higher specificity wins.  
The higher specificity is complicated series of rules that the computer follows to decide this very issue.

Find a cheat sheet or quick guide on CSS selectors, or refer to a cheat sheet you've already bookmarked.

What is a pseudoselector?
It seems like it is a way to modify an element in css with to run a method of some sort or to set a particular parameter or property.

How can you use CSS to select the child element of another element (for instance, a section inside another section, or an li inside a ul but not inside an ol)?
By calling a class or id and then afterwords calling a specific tag or class or id type to limit.  
This will call only anything of the 2nd type that is within the first type.
