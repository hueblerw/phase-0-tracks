Well first I need to have some sort of a clue what sorts of stuff can be done with jQuery and if I need to download information.

wikipedia mentions these:
1.DOM element selections using the multi-browser open source selector engine Sizzle, a spin-off of the jQuery project[12]
2.DOM manipulation based on CSS selectors that uses elements' names and attributes, such as id and class, as criteria to select nodes in the DOM
3.Events
4.Effects and animations
5.Ajax
6.Deferred and Promise objects to control asynchronous processing
7.JSON parsing
8.Extensibility through plug-ins
9.Utilities, such as feature detection
10.Compatibility methods that are natively available in modern browsers, but need fall backs for older ones, such as inArray() and each()
11.Multi-browser (not to be confused with cross-browser) support.

Basically, they are special functions made that can be accessed and used in javascript as usual when designing a website.  Really, you need to find things that work with the particular task you are trying to achieve.  My plan is too look around generally on the W3 schools site to get a big picture idea of what to do.  Then I plan to come up with the mini-project idea and attempt research anything I can to make that work.  Since, I tend to work better to a goal than just by screwing around.
 
I also find a nice basics instructional video that explains certain things like how the basic syntax works and the basic opening commands needed to operate it.

$('use css syntax to call elements').on('click', function(){
	insert code here
});

The above creates a listener object on one or a group of elements that will perform a task when clicked upon.  We can of course do this with hover over and such like.

Then I spent about 2 hours just trying to figure out how to get jquery onto the computer.  

Decided to then do a picture replacement swamp action.
