1.  Design Philosophies:

Small is Beautiful
Each Program Does One Thing Well
*** since each command does jsut one thing and does it efficently it can be written and executed concisely.
Prototype as Soon as Possible
Choose Portability Over Efficiency
*** moveable between machines
Store Data in Flat Text Files
Use Software Leverage
*** Use other peoples lean and efficent good code for your self
Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Avoid Captive User Interfaces
*** Don't limit the user by the interface
Make Every Program a Filter
*** Every command takes some information and change it and then pass the changes out.  Thus all programs take in and output data.

2.  A virtual private server (VPS) is a server accessible online that has its own copy of an operating system.  They essentially work like a normal physical computer but you don't own the location where the server is located but only get "virtual" or online access to it.
They are more secure as one location us protecting many.  If you need to increase server size other machines can simpky ve brought online.  You also get more control as you have access to the root.

3.  Being in the root gives you access to and power over every user on the machine.  Thus any error you make can damage the whole sytem vs just the user.  Also, security protections are designed with the expectation you are working as a user so if you do the wrong things  as a user the security may not protect you if you do them as the root.

Things to change:

Font-size would be fun to have shrinking / expanding fonts.  This though would drastically change other part of the screen I'm sure.  
Box-sizing to see what it would do.
transform to see the effect it has, but something to do with sizing and moving objects positions on the screen.
visibility to turn images on and off.
zoom, to affect the level of zoom on an element, possibly.
