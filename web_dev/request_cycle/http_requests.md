1.  Common http status codes:

Found this nice list.  Clearly 200 is important.  I've also encountered most of the 400's before at some time or another in normal websurfing.

301 Moved Permanently
302 Found
304 Not Modified
307 Temporary Redirect
400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
410 Gone
500 Internal Server Error
501 Not Implemented
503 Service Unavailable
550 Permission denied

2. GET seems to be for general information moving transactions where the information is either stored temporarily or locally.  Whereas POST can't be stored locally making it a little more secure but harder to access the data from the website itself.

Another synopsis:  GET supplies all data in the URL while POST supplies it in the server message body.

3.  A cookie is a piece of information sent from a website and stored in the users web-browser.
They can perform any task that having stored action state data as you move from site to site allows you.
It relates to web requests because this is information coming back from the website to the web browser and potentially stored in limbo for both to store and deal with.
