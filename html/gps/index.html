			<li><p>The purpose of semantics tags is to group elements of code that function or appear together in a manner such that their purpose is clearly labeled for both the purposes of later editing and stylizing as well as for rendering by other programs that will attempt to interpret the information contained inside.</p></li>
			<li><p>The html appears to be read first otherwise it appears that the browser will read from top to bottom.</p></li>
			<li><p>The snippets are cool.  I also finally got a much more coherent view of what the difference between a semantic element is and how they function.  I definitely will use snippets in future.</p></li>
			<li><p>Most challenging was a tie between the format of the snippet and solving it from first principles, and what will be the exact coders flow chart for how the semantic elements.  I've been trying to defocus as reccomended in the early learning videos and bypass details, but I find I struggle with that because its a learning strategy I'm less familiar with.  I prefer to get either a very organized picture of structures and their purpose and how they work <strong>first</strong> OR just to experiment and see the results of my experimentation and develop my own understanding from there.  I also am uncomfortable writing lines of code when I'm not clear of their purpose or meaning (though I recognize the need for this on occasion).  I feel just rolling with my uncertainty on exact meanings of semantic elements has thus far caused more grief than clarity.  It has only been when I experiment or dig into the nitty gritty that I really am getting comprehension here.  Being able to discuss with more other colleagues and teachers helps, but the social media is so unfamiliar to me I've been spending most of my effort in those sessions focusing on the communicative aspects and simple turn in procedure as much or more than coding.</p></li>
